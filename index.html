      <p>It's been an unyeilding passion to pursue knowledge and self advancement. For over 6 years 
         I've worked in healthcare and costumer service insuring patient care and satisfaction. 
         Through these exploits I've acquired a diversity of experties including medical software 
         and coding, data management, analytic and diagnostic proficiency, and collegial teamwork.
      </p>

      <p>As an extroverted and personable communicator with a proven track record in medical software,
         my focus on building strong professional relationships has been a valuable asset throughout 
         my career. I am eager to re-enter the professional sphere as a Full Stack Software Developer
         and apply my newfound qualifications and advanced language knowledge such as HTML, CSS, 
         JQuery, Node js, MySQL, and more to the job!
